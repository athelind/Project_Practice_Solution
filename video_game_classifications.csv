The story follows Lilly Reed, a newly appointed sheriff who has to win the confidence of her police officers and take down the drug cartel that threatens the town. 

The game is rated Age Advisory (Suitable for 16 & Above). 

The player takes on the role of Lilly Reed and makes daily decisions on how to best deploy her police officers. An overview of Sharpwood is shown, with crime reports popping up which have to be attended to. In addition, the player also has to gather clues to progress in the overarching investigation into the drug cartel. 

The player has a team of officers at his disposal, each with their own strengths such as physical ability, stealth, negotiation etc. They also have their own personality quirks and it is up to the player to deploy them efficiently to meet the challenges of each case. The officers can be equipped with various tools such as stun batons, tasers and tear gas, which presents them with additional options to subdue criminals. From a top-down perspective, the police officers are seen taking down the criminals and handcuffing them. Some of the violence is represented in still images, such as a picture showing bloodstains on a police uniform as well as a picture showing a severed head and limbs lying on a shelf. In some of the scenarios, the player is able to choose whether they wish to torture a criminal for information. Various torture options such as injecting a truth serum, confinement, using medical instruments are presented via text options. When these options are selected, the victim can be heard screaming but there is no visual depiction. 

The game also contains some instances of nudity, in the form of still images showing the back nudity of some characters. Some scenes imply sexual violence or sexual activity, such as an image showing the back view of a naked man pushing another against the wall, and an image of a woman in her undergarments straddling a clothed man on the bed, without visible genitalia. The Age Advisory guidelines permit “nudity without details” and “portrayal of implied sexual activity”.

There are some depictions of drug use in the game. One still image shows a man injecting a woman with an unknown substance. Another image shows the same couple injecting themselves with drugs. The Age Advisory guidelines permit “depiction of illegal drug use which is incidental to the game and not realistic”, if the “content of the game does not encourage drug use”.

The game contains the infrequent use of coarse language, including the expletive ‘f**k’ that can be heard in the story scenes."

Some decisions made by the player may result in violence, such as scenes depicting characters shooting themselves or others with guns. There is also a scenario where the protagonist has to examine the corpse of a character who has been murdered. The camera pans closely over the victim’s body, showing gashes and streaks of blood.

The game is rated M18 for violence and sexual references.

The player character explores the streets of Kamurocho to complete missions so as to advance the main storyline. The player will encounter enemies consisting of street thugs and gangsters who must be defeated so as to progress through the game. The player character uses punches, kicks and throws, as well as a variety of melee weapons and objects, to defeat his enemies.

Stronger depictions of violence occur during cutscenes and when the protagonist deals a finishing blow to an enemy. For instance, in one cutscene, a character is stabbed in the thigh by a knife, causing him to bleed from the wound. In other cutscenes, characters are shot by guns, leaving behind bullet wounds with details of bloodletting seen. When dealing a finishing blow to an enemy, the protagonist may be seen punching, kicking or throwing enemies against hard surfaces such as walls, metal bars and car bonnets. The player will also come across crime scenes where victims are seen lying in blood pools and blood splatter can be seen on walls.

As these depictions of violence are realistic and occur frequently throughout the game, they are more suitable for an M18 rating where the Classification Guidelines state that “depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters if the violence is not sadistic, cruel and abhorrent” may be allowed.

The game also contains several side-missions which the player can choose to complete.

In another side-mission, the protagonist befriends a hostess whom he may choose to patronise at a club. There are also some missions where a female detective goes undercover, such as becoming a nightclub hostess, and exploits her sexual appeal to seduce male characters and extract information."

Games are won by the team with the highest score at full-time, or when the opponent’s players have been wiped out. Dead players can be resurrected after the match if a fee is paid. Players in the team will earn experience points (XP) during matches, which can then be used to upgrade skill ratings to improve the players.

During matches, there is regular depiction of blood effects when players are tackled and struck. Players on both teams can also be dismembered and killed by special play moves (Eg. exploding or bladed balls), on-field traps and hazards. The scenes of violence can be allowed under M18, where the guidelines allow “Depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters if the violence is not sadistic, cruel and abhorrent”.

Coarse language such as ‘bitch’, ‘bastard’, ‘asshole’, as well as the expletive ‘f**k’ and its variations can be heard in the commentary. “Frequent use of strong coarse language” can be permitted under M18 guidelines.

The player may hear dialogue discussing the use of drugs, and lines containing sexual innuendoes. There are no visual depictions of drug use or sexual activity."

Played from a third person perspective, the player controls the main character Samanosuke to fight through masses of demons who stand in his way.

Blood spurts occur frequently in combat against the various demons and stain the surroundings briefly. However, the blood dissolves when the enemies’ bodies fade away upon defeat. Some scenes show more detailed depictions of violence, such as a man shot in the throat with an arrow; a devil’s hand and fingers severed in a magical explosion; a man stabbing his sword into a devil’s eye.  Under the Age Advisory guidelines, “Realistic but not excessively graphic violence with depiction of blood may be included in gameplay.”

The missions take place over 6 different locations across the world, where Agent 47 must seek out and eliminate those on his hit-list before disappearing undetected.

The game is rated M18 for violence and drug use.

Typical gameplay involves controlling Agent 47 from a third-person perspective to infiltrate and scout mission areas through the use of disguises and the evasion of patrolling guards and security cameras. Once a target is located, the player will have a number of options to carry out the assassination. Agent 47 can directly attack and kill the target, or sabotage objects in the environment to create hazards and make the murder look like an unfortunate accident. In the event of detection by guards, he can arm himself with a variety of firearms, explosives, and melee weapons to eliminate enemies. 

The missions require the player to assassinate human characters. Agent 47 can otherwise use non-lethal force on non-target characters, or avoid conflicts with them. Brief blood spurts are visible when characters are attacked, and surrounding surfaces will be stained with blood, while blood pools appear under corpses. There are various methods to kill victims in the game, such as attacking them with weapons, by poisoning, drowning in a toilet bowl, pushing from height off a ledge, electrocution, and from the impact of moving or falling objects. The stronger scenes of violence depict a handheld tattoo machine being jabbed into the side of a victim’s head; a man’s throat being slit with a razor; and a victim being thrown into a processing machine that shreds objects. The M18 guidelines allow “Depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters if the violence is not sadistic, cruel and abhorrent”.

During the course of gameplay, the player may encounter the use of drugs. Some characters can be seen smoking cocaine joints at various locations. In one scene, a drug trafficker may be seen taste-testing cocaine at a drug processing facility. In another, a man can be observed snorting from lines of cocaine off a counter top. These depictions can be allowed under M18, where guidelines state that “there may be realistic depiction of illegal drug use, but portrayal should not include instructive details.”

Coarse language such as ‘bitch’, ‘bastard’, ‘asshole’, as well as the expletive ‘f**k’ and its variations can be heard in the dialogue or seen in text. “Frequent use of strong coarse language” can be permitted under M18 guidelines."

The protagonist is a member of the Inquisition, charged with exterminating heretics, demons and aliens who threaten the Imperium of Man. The Caligari Sector, a secluded region of the Imperium, has fallen into chaos and it is up to the protagonist to restore order.

The game is classified M18 for violence and gore.

The player chooses a character from among three available classes to control and explore various stages from a top-down perspective. Each class has its own unique playstyle, ranging from heavy melee attacks, precise gunshots to magical spells. Further customisation is possible through selecting skills in each class’s talent tree as well as equipping different weapons. The objective is to kill the enemies in each stage and meet the various objectives, such as securing locations, collecting items and defeating the end boss. 

The depiction of violence in the game is strong, with details of blood and gore. The environment is generally grim and dystopian, where the player character frequently comes across blood and gore splattered on the surroundings, and piles of human corpses.  Enemies which are smashed with heavier weapons such as broadswords and war hammers explode into splatters of blood and gore. More precise weapons such as dual swords and sniper rifles can be used to target specific body parts of the enemy, resulting in dismemberment or decapitation. The game encourages players to use such tactics when facing the stronger monsters, as severing a monster’s limb will hamper its attacking ability and movement.  When a monster’s health has dropped to a sufficiently low level, an execution move can be carried out where the monster is killed instantly. One such execution animation shows the player character jumping onto the monster, ripping out its head and stamping it into a bloody stain. Overall, the impact of gore is reduced due to the top-down and distant perspective. The M18 guidelines state that “realistic violence such as killing, maiming or causing serious injury to humanoid characters can be allowed if not sadistic, cruel and abhorrent.”"

There are some horror elements in the game. While exploring the isolated corridors and rooms, there may be occasional jump scares when the player encounters digital apparitions of the Hayes family, as well as an ominous-looking silhouette. In one video log, a character appears with blood on his face, becomes delirious and starts hitting himself.

The game contains infrequent use of coarse language, where the expletive ‘f**k’ can be heard in the dialogue."

The player will control a party of mercenaries from a top-down view perspective to undertake a variety of combat missions against enemies that include regime soldiers, mercenaries and zombies. Player characters and enemy units will take turns to move and perform actions on the map, expending action points in the process.

Weapons such as assault rifles, machine guns, sniper rifles, knifes and grenades can be equipped. During combat, specific body parts can be targeted to incapacitate enemies. Traps can also be deployed to damage enemies that are lured into them. The player can approach missions with stealth, by sneaking and covertly taking out enemies undetected, or sniping them from afar. Alternatively, the player can launch frontal assaults, which raises the alarm in enemy camps.

Blood splattering is briefly visible when characters are attacked. Non-interactive scenes depict defenceless civilians and prisoners being executed by gunshots. The M18 guidelines allow “Depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters if the violence is not sadistic, cruel and abhorrent”.

The inhabitants of a town, Wellington Wells, take a pill called Joy which suppresses traumatic memories and brightens their perception of reality. The story follows three protagonists - Arthur, Sally and Ollie, as they cross paths while pursuing their personal objectives. The trio have to uncover secrets, face their pasts, and ultimately find the courage to escape the town and its false state of euphoria.

The game is classified M18 for drug use and coarse language. 

Played from a first person perspective, the player controls one of the protagonists over the course of the story chapters and explores the town in search of clues to uncover the plot. At the same time, the player must manage the need for food and water and also avoid the suspicion of the townsfolk, which may cause them to attack. While the player can fight back, the police will join in resulting in overwhelming odds against the protagonist.

The protagonist can pick up items and craft them into weapons to better the chances of winning combat. Hitting characters with these weapons can result in blood spurts, but the blood does not stain the environment. The player is encouraged to use stealth attacks by sneaking up behind characters, as this reduces the chance of other characters raising an alarm. 

The player has to manage intake of the pill “Joy”, which is consumed by all the inhabitants of Wellington Wells. Taking the drug allows the protagonist to blend in and also pass through gantries which check for ingested levels of Joy. Characters without sufficient Joy are electrocuted. Upon taking Joy, the surroundings become more brightly coloured and hallucinations such as butterflies and flower-shaped clouds will appear. However, an overdose of Joy will decrease character abilities and also make it more likely to arouse the suspicion of the townsfolk. There is also an optional side quest where the protagonist can infiltrate a cult meeting by consuming hallucinogenic mushrooms, which causes purple flashes to appear on screen. The M18 guidelines state that “There may be realistic depiction of illegal drug use, but portrayal should not include instructive details. Games should not glamorise or encourage drug taking or the primary intent of a game should not be to encourage the consumption of drugs to achieve success…” While there are depictions of drug use, there are no instructional details of preparation. The game does not encourage drug use as there are no associated rewards, and the game ends prematurely when decisions are taken to consume drugs at certain points in the story .

Coarse language is used frequently in the game, especially the expletive “f**k”. The player may encounter rooms where guests in tight-fitting leather suits shock each other with electric batons and make moaning sounds. While the depiction is mildly suggestive, there is no overt sexual activity."

The Titans are opposed by the main protagonists, who are members of an elite squad called the Recon Corps. In this sequel, the Recon Corps discover more about the origins of the Titans and fight to prevent the power of Titans from falling into the wrong hands. 

The game is classified M18 for violence and gore.

Played from a third person perspective, the player controls one member of the Recon Corps in various scenarios to fight against the Titans. The player character makes use of a manoeuvring gear to get in range of the Titans’ weak spots and slashes the Titan with swords to disable or kill them. Each scenario is completed when either a set number of Titans has been killed or the main Titan for the level has been defeated. 

The level of violence is strong and occurs frequently when player characters fight the Titans. The slashing attacks result in blood splatters, which stain both the character’s body and the screen. Blood effects fade away after some time. The limbs of the Titans will be dismembered when sufficient damage is dealt to the targeted body part. Other instances of violence are found in the cinematic cut-scenes, such as scenes of human victims being crushed in a Titan’s mouth or swallowed whole by the Titans; as well as a scene where a woman chops off a man’s arm and slashes another victim across the throat. These depictions of violence are appropriate under M18 where the guidelines state that “Realistic violence such as killing, maiming or causing serious injury to humanoid characters can be allowed if not sadistic, cruel and abhorrent.”"

With these armaments, the player can then defend better, and attack stronger creatures such as dragons and zombies as well as other players for more resources. The player can also capture or recruit other characters. As the game progresses, the player can form and lead a thriving settlement. 

Combat is a major part of the game, and the player can use a variety of weapons such as swords, axes and bows to attack other players or creatures.

During the character creation process as well as the early stages of the game, the main character is fully nude. The genitals of male characters are visible, while the crotch of female characters does not have details. The player has to find materials to craft clothing. While a player can choose not to adorn the protagonist with any outfit throughout the course of the game, it would be detrimental as there would be no armour protection and the protagonist would suffer more damage when attacked. In addition, some of the armour pieces of the female characters still show exposed breasts. The M18 guidelines allow “depiction of topless nudity or occasional full frontal nudity, if not exploitative.”"

From a third-person perspective, the player controls an individual soldier and moves the character to engage enemies in turn-based battle. There is a range of soldiers to choose from: scouts, assault troopers, grenadiers, snipers and tanks, each equipped with a specific set of weaponry. Violence is generally mild as the use of firearms to injure an enemy character is represented by sparks and the enemy’s health bar depleting. Defeated enemies fall to the ground and fade away, without any depiction of injuries.

The game also contains some instances of partial nudity that are depicted without details. Some of the female characters wear skirts into battle. When they adopt the prone position, their underwear is visible to the player. In one of the cinematic cutscenes, a female character who is relaxing in a hot spring suddenly stands up and starts issuing commands to her troops. The female character is naked but another female character uses her hands to strategically cover the former’s breasts and crotch.

Blood stains are also visible on the player character’s body, clothing and weapon. Kratos may deliver a killing blow to weakened enemies by breaking their necks, or crushing their heads with repeated stomps. He can also tear enemies’ bodies apart with his bare hands.

Violence is also depicted during cut-scenes where characters are slashed, stabbed or impaled with bladed weapons, spikes and arrows. A scene depicts an implied decapitation, where the decapitated head is then picked up and carried around on a character’s waist. Another scene shows mutilated bodies and decapitated corpses strewn on a deck. These depictions of violence are permitted under an M18 rating, where the guidelines allow “depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters if the violence is not sadistic, cruel and abhorrent”.

In the midst of his demon hunting duties, the player has to juggle his relationships with both his childhood sweetheart Nanako, and his neighbour Chiru.

The game is rated M18 for sexual references.

Played from a first person perspective, the game will automatically move the player through various locations in the school. Waves of girls will either run towards or shout declarations of love at the player. The player has to shoot the girls with his demon-capturing gun, which will expel demons from the girls. Capturing or shooting these expelled demons allows the player to earn points, which will award snacks that the player can use in wooing the female characters.

There are strong sexual references within the game. In the mini-game called “Doki Doki Mode”, a girl assumes a sexually suggestive pose and the camera pans closely over her body. The player has to shoot at her body parts such as face, breasts, buttocks, crotch, legs, which causes the girl to respond with moan or cries. Shooting the correct spots will expel demons which the players can then shoot or capture. As the mini-game progresses, the girl’s clothing will fall apart, eventually leaving her dressed in lingerie. In some story sequences the player can interact with female characters for courtship, such as giving them a massage. This involves using a cursor to probe various parts of the girl’s body, causing her to react with moans. These sequences are sexually suggestive and therefore more suitable under an M18 rating, where guidelines allow “still or moving images which may be sexually titillating (but does not contain nudity), e.g. scantily-clad women shown in a manner that is sexually suggestive, if not excessive or gratuitous.”"

The Hanzo National Academy fights for good and justice, while the Hebijo Clandestine Girls’ Academy provides mercenary services to evil corporations and politicians.

This game is rated M18 for some nudity and sexual references.

The player can play through the game via two story branches, as ninjas from either academy. Completion of missions, which take place across several chapters, unlocks costumes, hairstyles and accessories used to customise characters’ appearance. During these missions, the protagonists will typically have to clear waves of enemies from the various levels, or engage in a boss fight with a rival ninja. Battles typically start off with the characters in their school uniform, but they can morph into their ninja outfits to execute more powerful attacks. 

During combat, the depiction of violence is mild, with cries of pain and bright flashes of light illuminating melee strikes when characters are struck. Outfits of the protagonists and enemies will progressively tear off from battle damage.

The game contains suggestive and sexualised images. Several of the protagonists are depicted with voluptuous figures, with their bosoms jiggling exaggeratedly at any slight movement. As the female ninjas’ costumes are gradually torn off from damage, their underlying swimsuits can be seen. Powerful attacks can also entirely destroy their clothing, resulting in the defeated characters becoming naked. In the shinobi transformation scenes, they become momentarily nude as they morph into ninja costumes. In both of these sequences, bright light patches cover their breasts and groin areas obscuring details. In the ‘Dressing Room’ gallery mode, the player can view and customise 3D models of the female characters. An option in this mode allows the player to control two hand cursors to interact with the female character with groping and slapping motions. According to the M18 guidelines, “still or moving images which may be sexually titillating (but does not contain nudity)” can be allowed."

Completing main and optional quests allow the player to earn items and experience points to level up. 

Combat is initiated during certain story points, and also frequently when Kenshiro encounters raiders and thugs while exploring streets or driving in the wasteland. During combat, Kenshiro will face enemies who are often armed with a variety of weapons (blades, clubs, axes, etc).

The depiction of violence is frequent and strong. Characters spurt blood when attacked, which stains surrounding surfaces briefly before fading out. Enemies often die violent deaths as their heads explode in a splatter of blood, and the decapitated bodies turn into silhouettes that gradually fade out of the scene. Some cinematic scenes also depict strong violence, such as a character’s arms being broken and others being hacked in the head with blades.

Jonathan decides to rid the city of the vampire infestation but he must first find the source of the infection.

The game is rated M18 for violence and coarse language.

Played from a third-person perspective, the game’s protagonist completes quests to aid survivors or take down vampires. Jonathan gradually learns vampire abilities such as a claw attack using his hands, conjuring a spear that he flings at enemies, summoning a mist that explodes to damage nearby enemies, and transforming into a beast to attack random targets. He is also equipped with weapons such as machetes, knives, axes, maces; and firearms such as pistols and shotguns to use against enemies.

During combat, the infliction of violence is often coupled with details of gore. For example, blood splatters are seen when characters are struck. The blood stains nearby surfaces, such as the ground, and disappears shortly after. Violence is also depicted during cutscenes. In one cutscene, a woman is implied to decapitate a victim, whose head is later seen rolling across the ground. In another, a creature is impaled by a wooden stake.

Human corpses and skeletal remains may be encountered in the game. For instance, the player character may investigate deceased human victims to determine the cause of death by following trails of blood to locate the perpetrator. Some of the game’s locations also contain human corpses that are disembowelled and impaled on a spike. While exploring, the player character may come across creatures that are crouched over and consuming human remains.

Overall, the game portrays strong violence that contains realistic details such as bloodletting. These depictions are appropriate under M18 where the guidelines permit “depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters if the violence is not sadistic, cruel and abhorrent”.

In addition, the game contains frequent use of expletives such as “c**t” and “f**k”. According to the M18 guidelines, “frequent use of strong coarse language” is allowed. Characters also use swear words such as “damn”, “shit”, “bastard” and “bitch” throughout the game."

The game is classified M18 for violence and gore.

From a first-person perspective, the player undertakes the role of Maria to explore rooms and dark corridors. Typically, the game is comprised of still images representing various locations, where the player will control a cursor to click and investigate points of interest such as reading notes, examining objects and picking up items. Once sufficient clues are collected and studied to solve puzzles, subsequent areas will be unlocked. Navigating between locations requires the player to select a direction to turn to, or exit a room to the corridor. The player will occasionally be prompted to make action or narrative choices, and a wrong decision may result in Maria getting killed. Live-action scenes featuring real human actors, are interspersed throughout as the player progresses through the story.

The game has a strong supernatural theme and contains some realistic, intense and frightening scenes, particularly during the live-action sequences where the protagonist is chased in dark corridors and attacked from a first-person perspective. There are occasional depictions of violence accompanied by blood splatter effects. Blood stains can be seen on characters, and on some objects and surfaces. Some of the stronger scenes include an interactive sequence of a corpse’s finger being bent with a pair of pliers; characters being repeatedly stabbed in first-person view; and a man being decapitated by an attacker. These instances of violence can be permitted under the M18 guidelines, which state that “Realistic violence such as killing, maiming or causing serious injury to humanoid characters can be allowed if not sadistic, cruel and abhorrent.”."

The stronger depictions include a demon stabbing its hand into a human or demon’s body to extract a beating heart; a scene where a character crushes infant-like creatures with boulders; and the decapitation and dismemberment of human victims. Some of the game’s locations are littered with severed human body parts, human corpses impaled on stakes, and gory details such as blood pools and blood stains. According to the M18 guidelines, “depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters if the violence is not sadistic, cruel and abhorrent”, are permitted.

The game also contains some depictions of sexual activities. For example, in one cutscene, the player character comes across a room where several topless female demons are seen frolicking, including an obscured depiction of oral sex where a demon’s head is positioned near another demon’s crotch to imply the sexual act. Other scenes depict female demons having sex with the player character from a first-person perspective, with only the demons’ naked upper body visible.

These character models can also be viewed in the Gallery mode, where the player can rotate and zoom in on them. During combat, when a character has been defeated with a special attack, an animation plays where the defeated character is flung into the air and the clothes disintegrate, exposing the character.

The player is presented with multiple-choice questions in each scenario and the characters will react differently based on the answer chosen. These choices will impact how the story unfolds and there are multiple endings. Some of the choices will lead to encounters with monsters, which triggers a rhythm-based musical game that the player needs to play successfully to defeat the monsters and progress the game. The depiction of violence is mostly mild and implied by sound effects, with visible blood stains on walls and surfaces at some locations.

The game features several female characters with voluptuous body proportions and dressed in skimpy outfits. Throughout the course of gameplay, the player will encounter various scenarios where female characters are placed in sexually suggestive situations rife with sexual innuendoes in the dialogue. Some scenes show them in provocative or compromising positions with their panties visible; the protagonist walking in on female characters in the midst of changing or in a bath; and the protagonist accidently falling onto and grasping the breast of a girl. Clothing, steam or light effects strategically obscure details of nudity in these scenes. As the game frequently depicts such sexualised images, it would be more appropriate under an M18 rating where the Classification Guidelines allow “still or moving images which may be sexually titillating (but does not include nudity), e.g. scantily-clad women shown in a manner that is sexually suggestive, if not excessive or gratuitous.”"

Rose soon discovers that something has gone horribly wrong on board the ship and she must race against time to find her sister, all the while avoiding both human and non-human threats.

The game is classified M18 for violence and gore.

Played in first person view, the player controls the protagonist Rose Archer as she explores the Helios. The objective is to find clues to uncover the events that had happened on the ship and rescue Rose’s sister. Progress is blocked by barriers such as gantries and multi-lock doors; which the player must find ways to either unlock or get past them. Glowing after-images of the ship’s inhabitants provide the clues to do so.

The player must also avoid insane crew members and monsters who will attack the player character on sight. The protagonist has no ability to fight back and has to run away or hide from the enemies. When the protagonist is captured by enemies, she will be knocked down and stabbed by a knife, with spurts of blood staining the screen. The player will also frequently encounter rooms that are filled with mutilated corpses. Some of the corpses show more serious signs of damage, such as having their limbs severed; dismembered across the waist with entrails strewn onto the floor; having their heads partially or wholly decapitated. As these depictions are frequent, the game is more appropriate under a M18 rating where the Classification Guidelines permit “depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters.”

The game also contains some use of coarse language, such as the expletive “f**k”, as well as the swear words “shit” and “damn”."

During the course of exploration, she will be stalked by mysterious characters who will attempt to catch and kill her. While there is no combat system, Rosemary is able to use the objects she has picked up to wound the attackers, incapacitating them momentarily and giving her the chance to run away and hide.

Bloodletting is frequently seen in the game when Rosemary receives damage and when she fights back against her attackers. Should she be unable to fight back or fail to execute quick timed actions, a death animation will play. The death animations contain stronger portrayals of injury, such as a character hacking Rosemary's face with a sickle and a woman gouging Rosemary's eyes with her fingers. In addition, the cinematic scenes also contain some details of gore, such as a character cutting off another’s tongue with a scissors, and a woman repeatedly stabbing her own eyes. Such depictions are more appropriate under a M18 rating where the Classification Guidelines permit “depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters.”

The game also contains frequent use of coarse language, such as the expletives “cocks**ker” and “f**k”, which is contained under the M18 Classification Guidelines that allow “frequent use of strong coarse language.”

There is also some depiction of partial nudity. A character is seen wearing only an apron, leaving his bare buttocks visible. The player may also encounter some classical nude statues while exploring the house."

Depending on the player’s choices, Vincent will progress in romantic relationships with the female characters, which unlock scenes that show partial nudity and intimacy, or imply sexual activity. Such scenes include one where Vincent and a female character are hinted to be having sex under the blanket; a brief shot showing a female character straddling Vincent on the bed, with her bare shoulders visible; a female character colliding into Vincent resulting in her crotch being positioned on his face; Vincent looking at a girl’s bare body, with her body parts strategically obscured. These would be more appropriate under an M18 rating where the Classification Guidelines allow for “still or moving images which may be sexually titillating e.g. scantily-clad women shown in a manner that is sexually suggestive, if not excessive or gratuitous.”

The game also contains depictions of a homosexual relationship and mild intimacy between two characters. This is permissible under the M18 Classification Guidelines which allow for “some homosexual content, provided it does not glamorize the lifestyle or is exploitative”.

Fusaishi soon discovers that he is trapped in a time loop, doomed to repeat the deaths until he uncovers the killer. 

The game is classified Advisory 16 (Suitable for 16 & Above).

Gameplay involves the player selecting various dialogue options to progress the story. As the player experiences the various endings, more dialogue options are made available in the next time loop, which enables the player to explore more scenarios and work his way to uncovering the killer.

In one of the story scenarios, a female character approaches the protagonist while he is sleeping. Through the use of sexually-suggestive phrases, the game implies that the character engages in sex with the protagonist. As the depiction of sexual activity is done through text without any accompanying visuals, it is appropriate under an Advisory 16 rating where the Classification Guidelines allow “portrayal of implied sexual activity.”.

The game also contains some use of coarse language, such as the expletive “f**k” as well as milder utterances such as “bastard”, “shit” and “ass”. This is within the Advisory 16 Classification Guidelines which permit “coarse language such as the use of the expletive ‘f**k’.”

In addition, there are some still images depicting violence, such as a scene where a character is stabbed in the chest by a knife; an abstract image showing the aftermath of an attack where severed body parts are scattered on the ground.  Blood splatters onto the screen when there are textual descriptions of violence. However, these images are not too graphic or gory, and are contained under an Advisory 16 rating where “moderate level of violence” is permitted."

This game is rated M18 for violence.

The player controls Wolf from a third-person perspective to explore and progress through the various stages. The game’s enemies include humans, animals, demons and fantasy creatures. In some areas, Wolf can get past enemies undetected by traversing rooftops or creeping through tall vegetation. During confrontations, he can fight with his sword and a variety of secondary weapons attached to his prosthetic arm. The arm also has a grapple line installed that allows Wolf to move swiftly to rooftops and high ledges.

While progressing through the game, the player will encounter locations with blood stains and corpses.

Marie must explore various labyrinths, while avoiding killer mannequins and traps, in order to recover her lost memories.

This game is rated M18 for sexual references and nudity.

The player will control Marie to explore maze-like corridors from a first-person perspective, and search for clues in the form of film canisters and script extracts. Much of the game is rendered in a film noir, black-and-white style. Once sufficient clues are collected and pieced together, memories are unlocked and allow the player to progress to subsequent story chapters.

During exploration, the player will encounter mannequins that appear to be inanimate. If Marie turns her back on them, they will gradually sneak up and strike at her, causing a blood dripping effect on screen. The player may also come across blood stains on the surfaces of some areas, while a puzzle segment features corpses in bloodied body bags. The M18 guidelines allow for “depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters.”

The collectible film canisters strewn throughout the levels contain vintage-styled, live-action film footage which can be reviewed on a small screen in the editing room in each chapter. Some of the footage contain female nudity and sexual references, including depictions of women with their breasts exposed; a scene showing two female characters kissing; and brief scenes of female characters being bound by ropes or being lightly whipped with flogger props. The player may also come across rooms where stationary mannequins are arranged in sexual positions on beds. The M18 guidelines permit the “depiction of topless nudity or occasional full frontal nudity” and “depictions of same-sex kissing and hugging”.

The dialogue contains infrequent use of the expletive ‘f**k’, which can be allowed under the M18 guidelines."

The player’s party members use weapons such as swords and magic attacks to fight human enemies, animals and fantastical creatures such as golems and dragons. The game’s story is progressed by cinematic scenes that typically play after completing quests and battles.

Combat sequences depict mild violence where characters take turns to attack the enemy. Bright flashes of light, hit-points and sound effects appear onscreen to represent damage as characters are hit by attacks. When defeated, enemies collapse or freeze on the spot until the end of the battle. Cinematic scenes occasionally depict violence, such as one showing characters being tortured during an interrogation.

Completing missions awards various currencies that allow the player to purchase more weapons or unlock character traits.

The entity is tasked by a mysterious master to collect glands from various powerful monsters for some unknown purpose.

The game is classified M18 for violence.

From a third person perspective, the player plays as an alien entity who is able to possess the corpses of human warriors – referred to as ‘shells’ in the game. Each shell has different statistics and unlockable talents, is armed with different weapons (daggers, spear, sword and shield etc) and performs its own unique combat moves. Gameplay involves exploring a medieval fantasy environment inhabited by zombies and vampires. The entity is also tasked to fight giant monsters and extract their glands. These glands grant more abilities to the entity.

Blood spurts are frequently depicted in the game when characters exchange blows with each other. Some of the creatures display more detailed death animations, such as a vampire who explodes into blood and gore after defeat, and a zombie who rips off its own head to throw at the protagonist. The process of extracting glands is visually impactful as well, involving the protagonist thrusting his arm into a humanoid’s chest and pulling out the gland with a gush of blood. As such, the game is more appropriately classified under a M18 rating where the Classification Guidelines permit “depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters.”"

Played from a top down perspective, the player controls the Peaky Blinders to accomplish the mission objectives. The game starts with simple objectives such as picking up items or observing character interactions; and soon progresses to more complex scenarios where the player is required to synchronize the actions of multiple characters such as using one character to pull a lever while another retrieves a required item.

Some of the Peaky Blinders have the option to engage in combat. This is done by moving these characters next to valid targets, and they then start punching their targets with visible blood puffs. The characters finish off their targets by slicing their necks with the brims of their hats, resulting in a bright spurt of blood. The targets fall to the ground and leave behind a corpse.

It is set in 1930s America and revolves around Tommy, a taxi driver who finds himself caught between the Salieri and Morello crime families.

The game is classified M18 for mature content and violence.

Played from a third person perspective, the player controls Tommy to explore the town of Lost Heaven and undertake missions such as taking over rival criminal rackets, assassinating key figures from the Morello family and escorting convoys carrying illegal goods. In the process, he fights both rival mobsters and policemen. As such, the game is more appropriately classified under a M18 rating where the Classification Guidelines allow “content that requires the player to engage in illegal activities or play the role of a criminal, but without detailed instructions for committing crimes.”

During gameplay, Tommy uses a variety of weapons such as pistols, rifles and knives. Blood splatters are frequent when characters receive damage and the surroundings are stained as a result. Takedown moves can be executed against enemies and the camera zooms in to show the details of violence, such as Tommy hammering his pistol repeatedly into an enemy’s face or stabbing a man in the chest with a knife. In one mission, Tommy is shown shooting a man point blank in the head. Such depictions warrant a M18 rating where the Classification Guidelines permit “depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters.”

The player can collect book and magazine covers in the game. Some of the covers show women in sexually suggestive positions, such as one of a naked woman whose hands are locked in a stockade, and another image where a naked woman is restrained to a platform by straps which cover her breasts and groin area. One of the missions takes place in a museum, which contains classical nude statues with visible genitalia as well as paintings with various degrees of nudity.

There are some mild sexual references in the game. In one mission, Tommy breaks into an apartment to find a couple about to have sex, but both characters are still fully clothed. In another mission, Tommy explores a lounge and is propositioned by various prostitutes, but he cannot accept their offers.

There is some use of coarse language, such as the expletive “f**k” as well as milder swear words such as “shit”, “dick”, “bastard” and “whore”."

Played from the perspective of three different characters, the player tries to uncover the truth behind the outbreak.

The game is classified M18 for violence and gore.

Gameplay involves exploring various locations to find and complete quest objectives in order to progress the story, while either killing the zombies or avoiding them to conserve ammunition. The player character is typically armed with a handgun when starting a scenario, but will be able to find and equip stronger weapons such as machine guns and shotguns to more easily dispatch the zombies.

Blood splatters are frequently seen when the player character shoots the zombies. Attacks with stronger weapons such as the shotgun can decapitate or dismember them. It is also possible to shoot off the limbs of zombie corpses. The cutscenes also show strong depictions of violence, such as a scene where a man pulls another man’s arm off and blood gushes out of the exposed stump; a death animation where a mutant zombie rips a man’s head in half. The player may also come across some rooms where there are partially dismembered corpses strewn on the ground and gore stains on the wall, as well as a pillar that appears to be composed of various corpses. As such, the game is more appropriately classified under a M18 rating where the Classification Guidelines permit “depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters.” 

There is some use of coarse language in the game, such as the expletives “cocks**ker” and “f**k”. The M18 Classification Guidelines allow “frequent use of strong coarse language”."

Through his memories, players return as FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan to go back in time to unravel the mysteries buried within the once peaceful town.

The game is rated M18 for drug use.

The story begins with agents Davis and Jones conducting an investigation into the serial murders, having players jumping between past and present-day. The player will control Agent York to explore the town to search for clues in order to reconstruct the crime scenes in ‘profiling’ sequences and solve the murders. 

York will fight against enemies such as fantasy monsters in an alternate dimension and animals in the real world, using guns or melee attacks like punches and kicks. The depictions of violence are mild, with most of the blood details incurred on the protagonist, York. When he is attacked by enemies, damage numbers and small faint blood effects appear, with no visible injuries. Enemies produce purple clouds that disperse in the air when they are attacked. The player will encounter a scene depicting tight shots of a woman’s mutilated body, assumed to have been cut up in pieces. The bloody body parts are mostly obscured by the protagonist who is examining the body or is blurred out in the background. The player will never see the complete crime scene of the bloody body.

There are drug references in the game, including the presence of a fictional drug in the form of red powder that is encountered in the course of an investigation. The victim is alluded to have been under the influence of this drug. A cinematic sequence of an interrogation depicts drug use, where a character is seen rolling up a joint from a tray of cannabis, which he proceeds to light up and smoke. His cannabis consumption is commented on in the later part of the interrogation, where two of the characters state that cannabis is legal in Massachusetts and it is used for medicinal purposes. The M18 Classification Guidelines state that “there may be realistic depiction of drug or psychoactive substance abuse, if it does not promote abuse.”

The player will encounter two scenes of partial female nudity. A scene depicts the corpse of a naked girl frozen in ice, with her body cleanly chopped up in parts with no details of nudity. In another sequence, a naked girl is seen in an ethereal representation of the crime scene where her body is seen as a blue phantom, with cloth strips strategically obscuring most details of nudity. Some under-cleavage is briefly visible as the camera pans up the body. The player is able to take the time to examine the scene and gather clues but cannot interact with the body."

This game is rated M18 for violence.

Played from a third-person perspective, players control a young shark to hunt prey such as humans and marine creatures, evolving it to become the strongest apex predator of the seas. Most attacks occur in the sea but as the game progresses, the shark is able to attack humans on land as well. During attacks, the shark is able to use its jaws to bite down onto prey and use its tail to smash or whip its prey unconscious.

The game contains frequent depictions of the shark attacking humans. When prey is being slaughtered by the shark, copious amounts of blood splatter occur, which spreads out into the surrounding waters and stains the environment in the process. Larger prey require the shark to administer more bites and after its final bite, the prey will disappear with the blood clouds. The shark will meet a line-up of shark hunters and will be rewarded with upgrades after they are killed progressively. The game contains a few violent cut-scenes of the shark attacking and maiming a human character, accompanied by blood splatter and sometimes resulting in dismemberment. The M18 guidelines permit “depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters.”"

The game revolves around two girls, Jennifer and Linn, who try to find out their connection to the Felton family and their involvement with the drug, Phenoxyl.

The game is classified M18 for strong violence and sexual references.

Played from a third person perspective, the player controls Jennifer, Linn and other characters as they explore various locations to uncover the mystery of the Felton family and Phenoxyl. During exploration, they will be stalked by a range of antagonists, both human and supernatural, who attempt to kill them. The protagonists typically need to avoid enemies, and can use objects to hinder the attackers and run away.

Bloodletting is seen when the protagonists receive damage and when they fight back against their attackers. Failure to hinder or flee from their attackers will trigger death animations, such as an enemy impaling the protagonist with the sharp end of a walking stickthrough her mouth; a woman stabbing the protagonist in the head with a pair of scissors and a man shooting the protagonist with a pistol until she collapses. The cinematic scenes also depict some graphic injuries, such as a woman who is shot in the head and a man whose arm is severed. These scenes are accompanied with bloodletting. Overall, the depictions of violence are more appropriate under the M18 Classification Guidelines which permit “depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters.”

The game explores the romantic relationship between two female characters, showing them behaving intimately in a few scenes and finally kissing each other on the lips.  The M18 Classification Guidelines allow “depictions of same-sex kissing and hugging” and “some homosexual content, if discreet in treatment and not gratuitous.” There are also verbal references to sexual abuse and gender confusion.

The alien weapons inflict violence that is comical and without strong details. For example, one of the alien guns can disintegrate a human, leaving behind a set of skeleton that crumbles into a pile of ash. Another weapon fires a ray at a human victim’s bottom and causes the brain and brain stem to pop out of the neck, leaving behind a headless body. There are no gory details or severing of the limbs depicted in the game. These depictions of violence are contained under an Advisory 16 rating where the guidelines permit “moderate level of violence” that is “… realistic but not excessively graphic violence with depiction of blood”.

The game also contains some use of sexual humour. For example, some characters are heard using euphemisms (nightstick, 12-inch slider ruler) to refer to the genitalia.

Each fighter is equipped with their own unique weapon and special attack combos. While most of the fighters wield a bladed weapon, some carry a magic staff or a bow and arrow. 

The general combat across all the titles involves the fighters facing off against each other with combo attacks that include weapon strikes, hand-to-hand combat and special attacks. When the fighter is struck with a weapon, moderate amounts of blood splatter occur, sometimes staining the attacking fighter’s face and clothes in the process. As the fighter continues to take on damage, their skin will become progressively redder. In some cases, the fighter may commit suicide during battle. There is a chance that a fighter will be cut clean in half when administered with a weapon-based final attack. However, the impact is mitigated by the lack of gory details, where the inner halve of the body is coloured black.

By socialising and interacting with other characters, Sims can develop friendships and relationships, which may eventually lead to marriage and the starting of families.

When Sims relieve themselves in the toilet or take baths, they will remove all or part of their clothing. Babies in the game can be breastfed by mothers. A Sim may respond to a mischievous ‘streaking’ dare and run naked in the streets. In all the above instances, no nudity details are seen as a mosaic filter covers the characters’ bodies.

ORIGIN / ONECHANBARA ORIGIN,D3 PUBLISHER INC,2020,ASIA,Sony Playstation 4,Mature 18,Violence and Gore,"“Oneechanbara Origin” is a hack-and-slash action game where players assume the role of Aya, a zombie hunter who goes on a search to find her missing father while being hunted by her younger half-sister.

The game is rated M18 for violence and gore.

From a third-person perspective, the player controls Aya to fight zombies and nightmarish boss creatures as she traverses through the world. During combat, Aya wields a bladed weapon that will progressively become bloodier with each kill. The player must actively clean their weapon to prevent their attacks from weakening and becoming slower.

The game frequently depicts strong violence. When enemies are slashed at, voluminous amounts of blood spurt from their bodies, which stain the surrounding area, Aya’s clothing and her bare skin in the process. Aya is able to simultaneously attack several zombies, resulting in large blood effects. Enemies can be sliced in half, decapitated or dismembered when sufficient blows have been administered. When this happens, blood will spray from the severed stump of the neck or limb, before the corpses and body parts disappear shortly. As the depictions of violence contain frequent copious amounts of blood effects and gore, the game is more appropriate for an M18 rating where the Classification Guidelines permit “depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters”.

The game contains suggestive images of female characters. Throughout missions, the player’s character Aya is scantily-dressed in a cow-girl themed bikini that barely covers her breasts and reveals a large amount of cleavage."

This edition of the game includes the story expansion ‘Aftermath’ and two ‘Kombat Packs’ that add new playable characters and character skins.

This game is rated M18 for strong violence and gore.

The player can choose from a roster of fighters to engage in battles in the single-player story mode, or in a versus mode against the AI or other players. Each character has their own set of fighting moves and supernatural powers, but the player can also customise them with different abilities and gear items. The player will compete in rounds of combat using a variety of punches, kicks, grapples and weapon strikes to defeat opponents. 

During story scenes and in matches, there are strong depictions of violence and gore. In matches, the player will attempt to defeat opponents with punches, kicks, weapon strikes, and a variety of supernatural powers. At the end of matches, the victorious player has the chance to execute gory finishing moves called ‘Fatalities’. These finishing moves require the input of complex button presses within a short window of time to pull off successfully, and will result in characters being impaled, disembowelled, decapitated or dismembered. These depictions are in a fantasy context, and the ‘Fatalities’ occur briefly and infrequently given the overall length of matches. The M18 guidelines state that “Realistic violence such as killing, maiming or causing serious injury to humanoid characters can be allowed if not sadistic, cruel and abhorrent.”

The game dialogue contains the use of infrequent coarse language, such as ‘f**k’ and its variations. This is permitted under an M18 rating which allows the “frequent use of strong coarse language”."

After a terrorist attack, London has fallen under the control of various groups that seek to exploit its populace. The protagonist recruits various inhabitants into DedSec, a resistance group that aims to fight both security forces and organized crime.

The game is classified M18 for violence and coarse language.

From a third person perspective, the player controls a member of DedSec and explores the city of London. Gameplay involves completing missions such as hacking security systems, raiding criminal hideouts or rescuing citizens who are wrongfully oppressed by security forces. Amid doing so, the player also recruits more members into DedSec. Each member has a unique set of abilities which makes them more suited for specific missions. 

Characters can use a variety of weapons against the enemies in the game, ranging from normal rifles to more exotic weapons such as a drone with mounted gun. Blood spurts are frequent when characters receive damage. The characters can perform takedown moves which instantly kill an enemy. Some examples include shooting an enemy in the shoulder, then throwing him to the ground and finishing off with a shot to the head; strangling an enemy with a wire garrotte; and firing a nail gun repeatedly into an enemy’s body. These moves are depicted in slow motion and frequently accompanied by blood splatter. As such, the game is more appropriately classified under a M18 rating where the Classification Guidelines permit “depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters.”

Strong coarse language is used in the game, such as the expletives “c**t”, “motherf**ker” and “f**k” as well as milder words such as “arsehole”, “damn” and “shit”. The M18 Classification Guidelines allow “frequent use of strong coarse language”.

In one of the missions, the character ventures into a red-light district in London. The district is decorated with posters showing sensual images, and sex workers are seen propositioning in the streets. However, no sexual activity or nudity is depicted. In another mission, the character comes across drugs in the form of packets of white powder but cannot interact with them. The character can consume alcohol in the game, but excessive consumption causes the screen to blur and it becomes harder to control the character."

The game contains infrequent utterances of the expletive ‘motherf**ker’ and frequent utterances of the expletive ‘f**k’ by the various characters. This is more appropriate under the M18 rating where the Classification Guidelines allow “frequent use of strong coarse language.”

The game contains a depiction of drug use in which the player accepts a mission from a non-playable character who is shown to be snorting an unknown substance, and behaving in a euphoric manner."

He travels to the town of Dormont to resolve his relationship problems and ends up being caught in a supernatural landscape.

The game is classified M18 for some nudity.

Played from a first person perspective, the player controls Edward to explore the town of Dormont which appears to overlap with a supernatural landscape. Edward has to stay in lit areas as far as possible, as supernatural creatures often lurk in the darkness. Objects in the environment can be manipulated to either unlock progress or to provide some obstacles against the supernatural enemies that are chasing Edward. The objective is to solve the mystery of what happened to Dormont and resolve Edward’s relationship issues.

One of the enemies encountered is a monster with the head of a lamp and the torso of a naked female woman. While the torso is distorted with extra protuberances and faces protruding against the skin, her bare breasts are clearly visible. As such, the game is more appropriately classified under a M18 rating where the Classification Guidelines permit “depiction of topless nudity or occasional full frontal nudity.” In some of the rooms, the player may encounter classical art pieces with varying degrees of nudity. 

The depiction of violence in the game is reasonably mild. When supernatural creatures catch up with Edward, the screen fades to black, indicating his death. In one scenario, Edward can choose to punish a criminal by throwing a match into a car. The car bursts into flames and the criminal flails around briefly, but details of injury are blocked by the flames.

There is some use of coarse language, including the expletive “f**k”, and milder swear words such as shit and asshole."

The game is rated Advisory 16 (Suitable for 16 & Above).

The player completes quests to advance the plot, which alternates between the two protagonists. The game consists of navigation through menu options to interact with other characters, as well as a dungeon-exploring segment where player characters move through caves where enemies would appear and attack them. The player characters use weapons such as knives and swords to defeat enemies. Player characters can also use magical spells on enemies. Numbers appear above characters to indicate the damage inflicted on them. Enemies fall over and disappear when they are defeated.

The game contains suggestive images where female characters are seen wearing clothing that reveals the cleavage or the curvature of the breast. The clothing is occasionally in tatters. There are also some depictions of naked female characters who are seen with their hands over their chest, obscuring details of nudity. These depictions are contained under an Advisory 16 rating where the guidelines permit “still or moving images which may be mildly suggestive” and “nudity without details”."

It revolves around two protagonists who uncover the misdeeds of the pharmaceutical company Umbrella, the creators of a deadly virus that has spread across Raccoon City, and must fight against zombies and infected creatures to escape. The game also includes ‘Resident Evil Resistance’, which is a 1-vs-4 multiplayer game that pits 4 survivors against a mastermind antagonist who must prevent them from escaping.

This game is rated M18 for violence and gore.

Played from a third-person perspective, the player assumes the role of either Jill Valentine or Carlos Oliveira to fight against groups of enemies using weapons such as rifles, pistols, shotguns, plasma lasers and flamethrowers.

There are frequent realistic depictions of violence and gore that results in the dismemberment and maiming of characters. The player will encounter locations with mutilated corpses and burnt, blackened bodies strewn on the ground. Gunshots or fatal blows to the head cause characters to explode in a burst of blood. As a result, copious blood splatter frequently occurs, staining the walls and ground in the process. Some scenes depict human characters being pierced right through their body, disemboweled, or having their necks bitten by zombies. These depictions are more appropriate under the M18 rating where the Classification Guidelines allow “depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters”.

Coarse language such as ‘bitch’, ‘dickhead’, ‘f**k’ and its variations can be heard or seen in text during cinematic scenes and during the game. The M18 guidelines permit “frequent use of strong coarse language.”"

He aims to overcome the various obstacles in the camp to reunite with his family.

The game is rated Advisory 16 (Suitable for 16 & Above).

The player controls the protagonist who makes his way through the various levels of the camp by traversing platforms, solving puzzles and avoiding various dangers such as booby traps and guards. Failing to overcome these obstacles often result in a bloody death, such as being impaled by spikes, shot by a soldier, squashed by a machine or eaten by a crocodile. The protagonist can also intentionally lead other characters into traps in order to defuse them, such as an instance where a character falls into a spike pit and the protagonist steps over the body to safety. In these instances of violence, pixelated blood details are seen. As such, the game is more appropriately classified under an Advisory 16 rating where the Classification Guidelines permit “realistic but not excessively graphic violence with depiction of blood.”

There is a level in the game where there are two posters pasted on the wall that feature topless women. However, details of nudity are not clear due to the visual quality of the game, which adopts a retro, pixel art visual style. The Adv 16 Guidelines allow “nudity without details”.

There is some use of coarse language, such as the expletive “f**k” as well as other words such as “damn”, “bastard”, “ass” and “shit”. This is permitted under the Adv 16 Classification Guidelines, which state “coarse language such as the use of the expletive ‘f**k’” can be permitted."

The game is rated M18 (Violence).

The player controls a customisable character from a third-person perspective to explore the land, collect spirit cores and fight demonic creatures along the way. The player character encounters both human and supernatural enemies which must be defeated in order for the player to progress through the mission. During combat, the player character can equip himself with swords, axes, or bows, as well as administer magical attacks like fire and lightning to fight against soldiers, ninjas and demons. He is also able to defend himself by guarding with his weapon or stepping backwards.

When characters are slashed or struck with a weapon, voluminous amounts of blood spurt from their bodies, which stain the surrounding area and the player’s weapon. Enemies can be decapitated or dismembered, usually depicted during the final blow, when sufficient blows have been administered. When this happens, blood will spray from the severed stump of the neck or limb. The player will encounter locations with dead human bodies stained with blood, sometimes mutilated or dismembered, strewn on the ground. As the depictions of violence are realistic, coupled with frequent blood effects, the game is suitable for an M18 rating which permits “depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters”.

Players will come across a snake-like demon with partially exposed breasts, but details of nudity are obscured by moss and the demon’s hair."

(Ryu Ga Gotoku 7: Hikari To Yami No Yukue) is a roleplaying game that revolves around Ichiban Kasuga, a lowly yakuza who is released after an eighteen year jail sentence. He finds that he has been disowned by the clan and the balance of power has changed dramatically. With the help of a group of misfits, Ichiban seeks to reclaim his rightful position among the yakuza clans.

The game is classified M18 for violence.

The player controls the protagonist and leads a party of four to explore the streets of Yokohama and other Japanese cities, and complete quests to progress the story. Combat is played out in a turn-based format, where characters take turns to carry out actions such as buffing allies, blocking enemy blows, attacking enemies or executing special attacks. Most of the attacks tend to be unarmed combat, but characters can also be armed with items such as police equipment or baseball bats to increase combat damage. If there are objects such as chairs or signboards in the immediate environment, the characters will automatically pick them up to attack their opponents. Some of the characters have more outlandish abilities, such as using a lighter to breathe fire or setting pigeons to attack their enemies.

Blood spurts are frequently seen when characters are damaged. Some of the special attacks have stronger depictions of violence, such as a man impaling his enemy with a katana and hitting him with lightning and a character rubbing his opponent’s face into a giant wooden grater with copious blood spray. Some of the story cut-scenes also contain violence with strong details, such as a man using his finger to gouge another man’s eye; a man shot through the head with a crossbow; two men gunned down and shot repeatedly with blood spurts; and a few scenes showing characters who have been shot in the head, with visible bullet wounds. As such, the game is more appropriately classified under a M18 rating where the Classification Guidelines permit “depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters.”

There are some sexual references in the game. The protagonist will encounter a social escort agency where the walls are decorated with photographs of scantily-clad female models in suggestive poses.  An optional side-quest depicts a female character hitting a man with a cane, implying that he has an inclination for sado-masochistic (SM) treatment. The protagonist can also enter an adult toy shop and purchase a leather outfit for a female party member. The female character will then be dressed in a tight-fitting leather attire and attack enemies with a thin rod, a reference to typical SM behaviour. The protagonist may also encounter enemies who display perverted behaviour, such as a man who opens his jacket to “flash” a character; or a man who knocks his opponent down and rubs his body against her. There are no depictions of nudity and these attacks are more tongue-in-cheek rather than explicitly sexual."

The game is rated M18 for nudity and coarse language.

From a top-down perspective, the player will direct the movement and actions of a party of characters as they roam various locales. During their travels, the party will meet and engage in dialogue with other characters, and often undertake quests from them. The group’s hub of operations is aboard the Defiant, which is a ship that allows traversal between locations in the open world. The player can hire crew members, upgrade the ship and take it into combat against other ships. As more wealth is accumulated, new vessels can be bought.

Apart from ship-to-ship combat encounters, the party will have to overcome a variety of human enemies, creatures and demonic beings in direct confrontation during hostile encounters. During combat, there are frequent depictions of blood splattering which leaves blood stains on surfaces. Enemies often explode and dismember into unidentifiable chunks when killed. The M18 guidelines allow “Depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters”.

At a bathhouse, naked patrons can be seen standing around or submerged in the baths. One particular male character’s genital is visible, while the female character next to him has an exposed groin, but the depictions are not detailed.

The combat is frenetic, as the players are frequently attacked by waves of zombies and creatures charging at them. Large blood splatters are frequently depicted when enemies are shot, and leave behind blood stains on surfaces before they eventually disappear with the corpses of enemies. Zombies exhibit blood stains, lacerations and wounds on their heads, torsos and limbs. Their ribcages, organs and innards are also exposed and clearly visible.

The town is controlled by three criminal organizations, and she finds herself caught in the centre of their conflict.

The game is rated Advisory 16 (Suitable for 16 & Above).

The player progresses through story scenes, comprising images with some minor animation and text, by pressing buttons to select dialogue choices which affect how the story plays out.

There are some scenes depicting intimacy between the characters, with narrative text referencing sexual activity that is not visually depicted. One scene shows a man holding the female protagonist from behind and touching his honey-coated fingers to her lips, ordering her to lick his fingers. Another scene shows the female protagonist waking up in bed with a male character, who apologises for ‘pushing too hard’ the previous night. Such images and sexual references would be more appropriate under an Advisory 16 rating where the Classification Guidelines allow “portrayal of implied sexual activity”.

There is some use of coarse language in the game, such as the expletive “f**k” and other words such as “damn”, “bastard”, “shit”, “ass” and “bitch”. The Advisory 16 Guidelines allow “coarse language such as the use of the expletive “f**k”.

Scenes of violence are implied by still images and textual references, and not directly depicted. In some scenes, the characters are described to be fighting with swords or guns. These scenes are accompanied by blood splatters on screen and sound effects, but there is no actual depiction of the infliction of violence. In one such scene, a character’s appearance becomes increasingly bloodstained and the final image shows him lying on the floor, but details of injuries are not visible.

By night, he goes down into otherworldly dungeons, where he will battle against supernatural enemies such as skeletal soldiers and golems, and animals like dogs and snakes, to collect swords and materials. Players can also complete bounties placed on human characters such as serial killers for money.

During combat, the player character can equip himself with swords or bows, and administer stylized punches and kicks to attack enemies. When characters are struck by a blade, exaggerated, voluminous amounts of blood spurt from their bodies and stain the surrounding area. An attack by a bow produces less blood splatter. As there are no strong details of injury, these depictions can be allowed under an Advisory 16 rating where the classification guidelines permit “realistic but not excessively graphic violence with depiction of blood.”"

The events are set against an alternate timeline of World War II, where Hitler has raised an army of undead zombies to win the military conflict.

The game is rated M18 for violence and gore.

Players choose one of several characters to carry out missions in cities that are infested with zombies. Player characters are equipped with various weapons such as rifles, shotguns, pistols, mounted machine guns, as well as grenades and landmines which are used against waves of zombies.

The depiction of violence is often coupled with details such as decapitations and dismemberments when zombies are shot at the head or limbs. Blood stains and flesh pieces are also clearly visible. Player characters can stomp on zombies that are on the ground, resulting in blood splatter that stains nearby surfaces. The depiction of violence is sometimes highlighted by a slow-motion shot of a bullet’s trajectory until it hits and tears apart a zombie’s body. Similar depictions occur when a landmine or a grenade explodes on a large group of zombies. The player character can also activate a finishing move to take down a zombie instantly. For instance, a player character uses a knife to stab a zombie several times and wrenches its neck. In some locations, the player may come across the gory aftermath of human remains. These depictions of violence and gore are contained under a M18 rating where the guidelines permit “depictions of realistic violence, such as killing, maiming or causing other serious injury to humanoid characters”."
